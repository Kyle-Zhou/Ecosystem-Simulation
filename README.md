# Ecosystem-Simulation

### Overview

- Entities randomly traverse the grid each turn (tick)
- Humans of opp. gender that encounter each other will reproduce  
- Zombies that encounter a human will infect the human, turning them into a zombie
- Plants will "grow" after a random amount of ticks (within a given threshold) in all four cardinal directions
- Humans that move onto a plant's tile will consume it, gaining its nutrition as health and taking it's place on the tile
- Zombies that move onto a plant's tile will destroy it
- Each tick decreases the health of every organism by one
- The simulation ends when there are no humans left
